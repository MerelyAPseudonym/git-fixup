usage
-----
For this tool to make any sense you should enable the rebase.autosquash setting
in the git config.

$ git fixup
    outputs a list of commits that the staged changes are likely a fixup of

$ git fixup <ref>
    create a fixup!-commit of the given ref

$ git rebase -i ...
    commit rebased into the selected commit as a fixup

tab completion
--------------
The suggestions for the tab completion is the suggested fixup bases as
generated by running the tool without any arguments.

To be able to tab complete the command itself add a line like this to your zsh
configuration::

    zstyle ':completion:*:*:git:*' user-commands fixup:'Create a fixup commit'
